Here we will look into scattering cross sections and how the relate to scattering experiments.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
A typical experiment usually involves a beam of particles which is incident on some sort of target material as shown in figure \ref{fig:setup}.

\subsubsection{The Target}
The target material will have $n^{\prime\prime\prime}$ target particles per unit volume. If the target material is of some known composition\footnote{Either elemental or some known substance} then we can calculate the number of particles per unit mass of the target material.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:spesific number}
\tilde{n} = \frac{N_A}{\check{m}}
\end{equation}

where $\check{m}$ is the mass of a mole of the target material and $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant, which is the number of particles per mole\footnote{In the notation used in this book, we should really use the symbol $\check{n}$ as this is the number of particles per mole of substance. However due to this being a constant with an already agreed upon symbol, namely $N_A$, we stall stick to using that here.}.

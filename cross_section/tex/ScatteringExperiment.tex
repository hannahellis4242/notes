Here we will explore three different definitions of a tensor. Starting from the weakest to the most powerful.

\subsection{A Multidimensional Array}
A tensor can be seen a simple multidimensional array of numbers.

The first and most basic tensor is called a scalar which is an array with zero dimension, also called a rank zero tensor. Scalars are then just numbers. Examples include $1,2,-1,\pi$

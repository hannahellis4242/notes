# Setting Up

## Editors

You will need an editor for this course if you wish to follow along with the videos.
Provided below are links to some of the more popular editors.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

I personally recommend Visual Studio Code (as it's the editor I use in the videos) but feel free to use any editor you prefer, including one that's not listed here.

### Installing Node

You can download and install node [here](https://nodejs.org/en)

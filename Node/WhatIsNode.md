# What is Node

Node is a JavaScript engine very similar to the one built into your browser that parses and runs JavaScript from a website. Node however runs on your system rather than your browser, so it can do some things that your browser can't (such as process command line arguments and read files off your machine) but it also can't do something that your browser can (for example making a button submit a form on a website). Node even uses the V8 JavaScript Engine, which is the same JavaScript parsing engine that the Chrome Browser uses.

Node offers a way for developers more familiar with front end coding (ie JavaScript for a website) to write backend services or other programs.

# TypeScript

Here I aim to give you just enough understanding of TypeScript so that you can understand the code we're about to write.

Before I begin though, you should be aware that there is offical documentation on Typescript that you can find [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html). There are features that I won't be covering in these notes that you can look up there.

The topics I will be covering though include

- [Types](./Types/Types.md)
- [Modules](./Modules.md)

# CRUD

CRUD is an acronym often used when thinking about a REST API.
It stands for

- Create
- Read or Retrieve
- Update
- Destroy or Delete

and is a reminder of the sorts of things you most likely want to be able to do with some data.

You might hear someone call a server built to handle data in this way a "CRUD Server" or a "CRUD Service".

## REST equivalents

REST API's have a number of methods that get sent with the request, but the most common ones used with a "CRUD server" are POST, GET, PUT and DELETE. With

- POST being the equivalent of Create
- GET being the equivalent of Read
- PUT being the equivalent of Update
- DELETE being the equivalent of Destroy

## Sending and Receiving JSON

Before we begin looking how to write a "CRUD server", we should talk a little about how we transfer data around.

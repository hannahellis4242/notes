# The Triple Product Rule in Calculus

## Introduction

The triple product rule is an extension of the product rule for differentiation, used when differentiating the product of three functions. If $u(x)$, $v(x)$, and $w(x)$ are functions of $x$, then the derivative of their product can be calculated using the triple product rule.

## The Triple Product Rule

Given three differentiable functions $u(x)$, $v(x)$, and $w(x)$, the derivative of their product with respect to $x$ is given by:

```math
\frac{d}{dx} \left[uvw\right] = \frac{du}{dx}vw+u \frac{dv}{dx}w + uv\frac{dw}{dx}
```

In other words, we differentiate each function once while keeping the other two functions constant, and then sum the results.

## Derivation of the Triple Product Rule

We begin with the expression we want to differentiate:

```math
\frac{d}{dx} [uvw]
```

### Step 1: Group Two Functions Together

To derive the rule, we first group two of the functions together. Let $g = u v$, so that the original expression becomes:

```math
\frac{d}{dx} [gw]
```

### Step 2: Apply the Product Rule

We apply the standard product rule for differentiation, which states:

```math
\frac{dgw}{dx}= \frac{dg}{dx}w + g\frac{dw}{dx}
```

### Step 3: Differentiate $g$

Now we need to find the derivative of $g(x) = u(x)v(x) $. Using the product rule again, we get:

```math
\frac{dg}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx} [uv] = \frac{du}{dx}v + u \frac{dv}{dx}
```

### Step 4: Substitute $\frac{dg}{dx}$

Substitute $\frac{dg}{dx}$ back into the expression for the derivative of the original product:

```math
\frac{duvw}{dx} = \left[ \frac{du}{dx}v + u \frac{dv}{dx}\right]w + uv\frac{dw}{dx}
```

### Step 5: Expand the Expression

Expanding this expression gives:

```math
\frac{duvw}{dx} = \frac{du}{dx}vw + u \frac{dv}{dx}w + uv\frac{dw}{dx}
```

This is the triple product rule, showing that the derivative of the product of three functions is the sum of the derivatives of each function, with the other two functions held constant in each term.

## Extension to Higher Products

The approach used in deriving the triple product rule can be extended to products of more functions. For example, the derivative of four functions \( u(x) \), \( v(x) \), \( w(x) \), and \( z(x) \) would be:

```math
\frac{duvwz}{dx}= u' v w z+ u v' w z+ u v w' z+ u v w z'
```

The pattern generalizes to any number of functions, with each term in the sum representing the derivative of one function while keeping the others constant.

## Conclusion

The triple product rule is a natural extension of the product rule for differentiation and provides a straightforward method for finding the derivative of the product of three functions. By iteratively applying the product rule, we can derive similar rules for differentiating products of more functions.

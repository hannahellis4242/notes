# Circumcircle of a triangle

The circumcircle of a triangle is a circle of minimum radius that fully contains the triangle.

Since you can construct a circle that goes through any three points, the circumcircle will actually touch the three corners of the triangle.

This means constructing the circumcircle is the same as constructing a circle through three points.

## Equation of Circle

The equation for a circle centred at (a,b) with radius c is given by
``` math
(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=c^2
```

This can be expanded and rearranged to give
``` math
\begin{align*}
(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2&=c^2 \\
x^2 -2ax-a^2+y^2-2by+b^2 &= c^2 \\
-2ax-2by+a^2+b^2-c^2 &= -x^2 -y^2 \\
-2ax-2by+a^2+b^2-c^2 &= -x^2 -y^2 \\
\end{align*}
```

# Circumcircle of a triangle

The circumcircle of a triangle is a circle of minimum radius that fully contains the triangle.

Since you can construct a circle that goes through any three points, the circumcircle will actually touch the three corners of the triangle.

This means constructing the circumcircle is the same as constructing a circle through three points.

## Finding the centre

### Method 1

This method uses the fact that the distance to the centre of the circumcircle to each corner is the same for every corner.

The triangle corners are labelled $A$,$B$ and $C$ and the centre of the circumcircle is lablled $O$

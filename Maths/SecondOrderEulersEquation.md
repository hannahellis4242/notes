# Second Order Euler's Equation

The Euler Equation is a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients and is also known as the Euler–Cauchy equation, or Cauchy–Euler equation.

The general form is as follows
``` math
a_n x^n y^(n)(x) + a_{n-1} y^(n-1)(x)+ \ldots + a_0 y(x) = 0
```

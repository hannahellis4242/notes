# Templates

[up](./Scala.md)

sbt comes with a number of pre-defined templates you can use. You can find the complete list [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-new-and-Templates.html). To use these templates to start your project, you can just type

``` bash
sbt new <template>
```

for example to create a basic "hello world" setup you would type

``` bash
sbt new scala/scala-seed.g8
```

# Orbits extended

The following contains notes to add to the full version once ready.

## Three results we will be using here

In the orbital plane

1. The angular momentum for an orbit is given by

``` math
l = m r^2 \omega
```

where $l$ is the magnitude of the angular momentum (the angular momentum vector is directed along the z axis normal to the plane in a right handed coordinate system)

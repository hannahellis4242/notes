# Orbits extended

The following contains notes to add to the full version once ready.

## Three results we will be using here

In the orbital plane

1. The angular momentum for an orbit is given by
   ``` math
   l = m r^2 \omega
   ```
   where $l$ is the magnitude of the angular momentum (the angular momentum vector is directed along the z axis normal to the plane in a right handed coordinate system)
2. In an eliptial orbit the angular momentum per unit mass (of the orbiting body) is given by
   ``` maths
   \frac{l}{m}&=\sqrt{GM\frac{2ap}{a+p}}
   ```
   where $a$ and $p$ are the apoapsis and periapsis respectively.
3. The equation for an elipse in polar coordinates is given by
   ``` maths
   r(\theta)=\frac{A(1+e)(1-e)}{1+e \cos \theta}
   ```
   so that the periapsis at $\theta = 0$
   > Note this is different to what is given in the other notes, as that has the apoapsis at $\theta = 0$. Can update this for everything later.
